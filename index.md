# Sun Tracker Solar Powered Phone Charger
 This solar powered phone charger uses the Sun to power a battery and charge a phone. However, it can also track the movements of the Sun and will tilt towards the Sun like a sunflower.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is hooking up the servo to the arduino. This is a large part of my project as it uses the gears to reposition the swivel of the solar panels to catch the most sunlight possible. I hooked it up to the arduino and made sure that it worked, writing a sample code to test out the motors.
